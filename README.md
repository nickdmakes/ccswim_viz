<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

CCSWimViz was inspired by the lack of time searching capabilities within the College Club Swimming (CCS) organization. Prior to this web application, a typical CCS athlete needed to sift through archived competition data to view their previously swam events.

CCSwimViz makes searching athlete competition data much easier and opens new avenues for data visualization, coaching tools, and more.

This public codebase works alongside other private Github repositories to make the CCSwimViz system work. Architecture and documentation for the entire system can be found in the [wiki here](https://github.com/nickmatthews713/ccswim_viz/wiki).
